# ILMerge

ILMerge is a utility that merges multiple .NET assemblies into a single assembly.

This is the beginning of a port of [ILMerge](https://github.com/Microsoft/ILMerge) to use this version of CCI.
It has some of the rudimentary functionality, but is lacking many (*many*) of the options/features that the
existing version has.
